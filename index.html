            <b>About the run machine king kohli.</b>
             <p1>He was born on november 5th 1988.</p1>
             Virat, a 13-year-old, is selected for the Delhi Under-15 team for the Polly Umrigar Trophy in October. He ends the campaign as Delhi's leading scorer.
             Virat is chosen for the India Under-19 team for the first time after making an impression at the youth level for Delhi. He then had a fantastic tour 
             of England, averaging over 100 in the one-day series.
             Virat is chosen for the India Under-19 team for the first time after making an impression at the youth level for Delhi. He then had a fantastic tour
             of England, averaging over 100 in the one-day series.
             Royal Challengers Bangalore, an IPL team, signs Virat on a youngster contract for just Rs 12.5 lakhs when he is still a minor.  
             Virat received his maiden call-up to the Indian ODI team and participated in the entire five-match series against Sri Lanka on the road. In the
             fourth game of the series, he hit his first 50, a 54-run inning.
             When Virat got his first ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111, it was worth the wait for him to return to the national squad.
             Virat participated in every game of India's victorious World Cup campaign in 2011, scoring his only century against Bangladesh in the opening match.
             Despite the fact that he didn't exactly light up the tournament with his bat, his final-round remark to Sachin has since become legendary in
             cricket: "Sachin Tendulkar has carried the weight of the nation for 21 years." Time for us to carry him on our shoulders. Every cricketer will 
             answer "play Test cricket" when asked what their dream is. In 2011, Virat finally had the opportunity to play in his first Test match against the West Indies.
             Unfortunately for the charming lad, it was a forgettable experience as he scored just 19 runs in the two innings he played.  
             In the fourth and final test against Australia in Adelaide, Kohli achieved his first test hundred under somewhat dramatic circumstances. He just avoided 
             being run out when batting with Ishant Sharma and nearly ran out of partners. However, he was unable to save India. 4-0 was our series loss.
             Virat led India to the CB Series final in Australia with what is undoubtedly one of the best ODI efforts by an Indian batsman, hitting 133 not out
             against Sri Lanka off just 86 balls. Hobart witnessed one of the greatest batting performances in history as India, who was chasing 321, reached the score in 37 overs.  
             In place of an injured MS Dhoni, Virat was selected the stand-in ODI captain when India visited the West Indies. Earlier that year, he had also been named
             captain of his IPL team, the Royal Challengers Bangalore.
             When summoned to replace an ailing MS in Australia once more, Kohli experienced his first taste of Test captaincy. In Adelaide, he celebrated by 
             scoring centuries in both innings. In what was an exceptional
             In addition to purchasing a share in the IPTL team UAE Royals, Kohli expanded his interest in tennis after becoming a co-owner of ISL football club FC Goa the year before. 
             He produced arguably his finest innings of his young career as India defeated Australia in Mohali to go to the ICC World T20 semifinals. As opposed to the lappa kind of 
             cricket that is typically associated with 20 over cricket, his 82 off 51 balls was a magnificent effort, carved with timing and technique.
